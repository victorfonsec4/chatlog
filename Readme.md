#facebook connect for chrome extension

This is a sample on how you can connect to facebook and retrieve access token if you are intrested in fetching various types of data from Graph Api. 
Since it is quite difficult to to try using facebook Official JS SDK, [Mr.Nobu Funaki](https://github.com/zuzara) originally 
worked on this. Since he worked on an earlier version of Chrome and Manifest, I have updated it to the latest one and 
also removed some of the bugs.
